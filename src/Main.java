-Users can buy a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2 tickets.
-Payment is accepted in cash, and each ticket costs 1 USD.
-After choosing tickets and quantity, the system prompts the user to pay in cash or by bank card.
-This system only accepts 1 USD and 5 USD bills. The user must choose the bill to use for payment, and the system should return the change if applicable.
-After payment, the ticket is issued.
-The user returns to the main menu to play the lottery.
-The lottery system generates 1 random ticket code.
